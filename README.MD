This is simple bash script to fix node-id changing. It checks your id every 30 seconds and if it doesnt match yours, change it back

# How to run
```
# CLone minima-fix-id.sh to your server
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isafin509/minima/main/minima-fix-id.sh
# Open file with nano or other text editor
nano minima-fixid.sh
# Replace YOUR_NODE_ID with your minima node-id
# It must look like this
nid="72bxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxds4"
#Save changes and exit
```
